      <h2> About me</h2>
      <p> I've done many things, and worn many different hats over the years.
          I've always focus on projects and jobs where I can learn new skills and implement old ones too.
         I think the following sums up my background best:</p>

         <p>I'm a Aviation graduate with a passion for technology and longboarding and have spent sa considerable amount
           of time after graduation learning about SEO, SEM and pursuing my passion for IT.
            I completed a DBIT program at Strathmore University, and I'm polishing my developer skills now at the Moringa school intro course.
          Finally, I also work as a content writer and have my own niche blog - downhill254.com.
            I am extremely committed to pursuing my passions and overcoming any challenges that present themselves. </p>
